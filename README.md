# MLOps on Databricks

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to demonstrate Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).

MLOps is a set of practices designed to streamline the development, deployment, and management of code, data, and models in order to improve performance, stability, and long-term efficiency of ML systems. 

## Overview
The guide covers essential MLOps concepts, and I'll demo tasks such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

We'll set up GitHub actions to run tests on each pull request too.

## Data

Note: I have uploaded the `daily_minimum_temperatures_in_me.csv` dataset to DBFS for ease of access with PySpark.
